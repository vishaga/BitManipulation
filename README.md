# BitManipulation

Bit manipulation, also known as bitwise operations, refers to the manipulation and modification of individual bits within a binary representation of data. In computing, data is often stored and processed at the binary level, where each piece of information is represented using a sequence of 0s and 1s (bits). Bit manipulation allows you to work directly with these binary representations to perform various operations efficiently.

Bit manipulation operations commonly include:

Bitwise AND (&): Performs a bitwise AND operation on each pair of corresponding bits in two binary numbers. The result is 1 if both bits are 1; otherwise, it's 0.

Bitwise OR (|): Performs a bitwise OR operation on each pair of corresponding bits in two binary numbers. The result is 1 if either or both bits are 1.

Bitwise XOR (^): Performs a bitwise XOR (exclusive OR) operation on each pair of corresponding bits in two binary numbers. The result is 1 if exactly one of the bits is 1.

Bitwise NOT (~): Performs a bitwise NOT operation on each bit in a binary number, inverting 0s to 1s and 1s to 0s.

Bitwise Shifts (<< and >>): These operators shift the bits of a binary number left or right by a specified number of positions. << is a left shift (multiply by powers of 2), and >> is a right shift (divide by powers of 2).

Bit manipulation is often used in low-level programming, embedded systems, device driver development, and algorithm optimization, as it can lead to more efficient code and compact data storage. Common use cases include setting or clearing specific bits in a bit mask, checking the status of individual flags or attributes, and optimizing mathematical operations that involve powers of 2.

For example, if you have a binary number 1011010, you can use bitwise operations to change specific bits or extract certain information from it. Understanding bit manipulation is crucial in various computer science and engineering fields, including hardware design, cryptography, and algorithms.
